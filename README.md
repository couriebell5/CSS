# CSS-BOEHD-features
In this paper, we present a novel computerized spermatogenesis staging (CSS) pipeline for identifying Stages IV-V. First, a multi-task learning (MTL) model is developed to segment the multiple testicular cells (MTCs) without exhaustive requirement for human annotations. Then, a multi-scale learning (MSL) model is employed to integrate local and global seminiferous tubule information to distinguish Stages I-V from Stages VI-XII. Finally, we develop a new graph-based feature called bag-of-edge histogram and distance (BOEHD) for discriminating Stages IV-V from Stages I-III.

The code in this progject will reproduce the results in our paper submitted to Bioinformatics, "Multi-task learning based histomorphological analysis for mouse testicular cross-sections: towards computerized spermatogenesis staging". Code is written in matlab and python.
